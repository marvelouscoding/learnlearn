Dear [Recipient’s Name],

I apologize for any inconvenience; I attempted to call, but the connection was not clear. I am available all day tomorrow except between 12:30 to 1:00 PM EST.

Please let me know if another time works better for you, and I am happy to adjust accordingly.

Thank you, and I look forward to connecting soon.

Best regards,

Swati

Let me know if you’d like any further adjustments!
